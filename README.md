# 4.2 Lab

## Overview

In this project we implemented CSS and formatted HTML to make a fake website. The website was a birdwatching website that needed to include a banner with logo, navigation bar, welcome information, pictures that link to bigger versions of those pictures, and a end bar for copyright credits.
